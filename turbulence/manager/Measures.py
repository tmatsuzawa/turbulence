"""
Main programm to run the different kind of data analysis :
    Call the following modules :
    decay : decay of the total energy in the field
    corr : correlation functions in time
        compute_Ct : autocorrelation function in time
        spatial_correlation : correlation in space, by taking N random pair of indices in each slot of distance d,d+Delta between them
    Fourier : fourier transform in 1d or 2d in space
        display_fft_vs_t : compute the 1d Fourier spectrum over time, and fit by a K-spectrum. Eventually plot the Energy contained in the turbulence cascade as a function of time
    early_time : temporal evolution of the flow (isotropy, homogeneity)
        isotropy : plot the isotropy coefficient between the two axis as a function of time
    taylor_scale : Calculation of the Taylor microscale, ie the typical length scale of spatial variation of the strain tensor 
        taylor_scale : currently based on a spatial averaged of Uâˆ‚_{x,y}U.
        to be implemented : from the curvature of the spatial correlation function for d -> 0 (!)
        
    Old measurement technics, to be updated :
        Distribution of velocity or its increments for various spatial scales
        Decaying energy for each vertical line
        Vertical transport of turbulent kinetic energy over time
            
    To be added :
        Computation of the mean flow from a set of same experimental parameters runs ("smart" alignement needed to adjust slightly different camera positions)
        Vorticity calculation, distribution of vorticity
